# Data Structures and Algorithms 
This repository will contain my backup solutions for Weekly given problems during the university (IIUM) course that i'm taking this Semester (DS & ALGO) //Course code: ECIE3312 .
Basically we'll be implementing problems using python 3 only but i'll be uploading them in C++ as well.
